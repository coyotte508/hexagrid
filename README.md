# hexagrid
Hexagonal grid in typescript, for npm, inspired by [redblobgames](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) and [honeycomb](https://github.com/flauwekeul/honeycomb).

This code is meant for backend and reasonably fast algorithms on hexagonal grids. To have visualisation data
such as pixel coordinates of the center & corners of the hexes, use **honeycomb**.
